# Hackathon2020
Elderoo

Inspiration
We wanted a simple and easy to use solution for elderly people who were struggling to get groceries.

What it does
Allows people to either sign up as an Elderly or a Helper. Helpers accept requests made by the elderly and deliver their request to them.

What we learned
We learned how to create a website using the Express package as back-end to work in conjunction with the front-end in a short span of time

What's next for Elderoo
Nothing really... We do feel like it is a good idea that can be expanded upon in the future!
