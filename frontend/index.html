<h1>Enabling volunteers and helpful citizens to reach out to vulnerable people in need.</h1>
</div>
<br>
<div class="formdiv">
<p>At Elderoo, we provide a service to enable vulnerable and elderly people in society who are at risk whenever they go out for their needs instead allow others within their local area to carry out tasks for them.</p>
<p>By signing up for an account, whenever you need a request taken care of, such as shopping, dropping of an item at someone's house, and so on, you can simply upload that request on to the site. Then, volunteers within the area who are logged on will be able to view any requests made within their area, including yours, and then choose to accept requests and carry them out for them for free.</p>
<p>If you feel like providing a service to the community and helping elderly/vulnerable people within your area, please do sign up for an account to be able to help them and view and accept requests.</p>
